# Dice Game (Sprint 6)

## Description

This application was built as part of the Node.js IT Academy curriculum. The primary objective was to learn how to implement persistent databases using a MySQL relational database and a NoSQL database (MongoDB) with Docker. The app currently allows you to add players to a database and have a player roll 2 dice. If the sum between the 2 dice equals 7, the player wins. Anything else is a loss. The app also keeps track of all the players dice rolls and calculates a win percentage. Which then can be used to rank the players from best to worst, get a winner and a loser.

## Installation 

To install this application, you need to have Docker installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

You will also need MySQLWorkbench to create a user for the MySQL database. You can download it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

Once installed open the MySQLWorkbench app. Create a new connection. Keep the default setting. `Hostname: 127.0.0.1`, `Port: 3306` you can name the connection `sprint6`. You will be prompted to create a password for the root user. Once you have done that, you can create a new user by clicking on the `Users and Privileges` tab. Click on the Add Account button. Enter a username and password. Make sure the account has all privileges.

You can also run the following queries to create the database and user:  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sprint6;
CREATE USER 'juan1'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '1234';
GRANT ALL privileges ON * . * TO 'juan1'@'%';
``````

Once you have Docker and MYSQLWorkbench setup, you need to clone this repository. You can do it by downloading the zip file or by running this command on your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alejandroN99/Sprint6.git
```

Once you have the repository on your computer, you need to open a terminal on the root folder of the project and run this command:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

followed by 

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will build the images for the MySQL and MongoDB databases and run them. 

Once they are running you can access the app at http://localhost:8000/

## MongoDB

You can also use this app with MongoDB to do so you need to install MongoDB Compass. You can download it from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

Once you have it installed create a "New Connection" with the following URI:
`mongodb://localhost:27017`

Then you need to open a terminal on the root folder of the project and run this command to start the sever:

```bash
npm run mongo
```

and to start the front-end, in a new terminal run:
```bash
npm run front
```

## Stack

The technology used to build this app is:

-Node.js: a javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which allows to use this language in the server and not only in the client.

-Typescript: a javascript superset, helps greatly at reducing errors during the bulding process and vastly improves code readability.

-Express: a Node.js framework that simplifies the process of creating APIs. It has become the defacto standard to build servers with Node.

-Sequelize: a Node.js object relational mapper for SQL databases. It helps to reduce database building time and prevent common vulnerabilites (SQL injection).

-Mongoose: a Node.js object data modeling for MongoDB. It's purpose is similar to Sequelize.

-Docker: a platform to bundle an application and all it's components and dependencies to ensure the application runs perfectly anywhere, without set-up issues.

-Jest: a Facebook library made for testing applications in Node.js.

-React: a Facebook library that allows to build a front-end with reusable components.

-Vite: a javascript framework focused on performance and ease of use for developers. It barely requires set-up.

-Git: a control version system that allows to keep track of the files in a project, test different new features without overriding the base code, work in collaboration with other devs and have an online repository of the project on Github, a hosting service for Git.

## App structure

On the root level there's a lot of config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, jest.config.json, node_modules folder...) and the main folders for the project. This folders are:

-src: contains the main logic of the application. It has 2 main subfolders, 1 for MySQL and 1 for MongoDB. Each one has the necessary functions to store and manipulate the user data for the game to work and the logic of the game itself.

-dist: contains the final javascript output from the typescript transpilation.

-tests: contains all the tests made to ensure the app functions as expected.

-website: contains all the React assets to build the user front-end for the application.
